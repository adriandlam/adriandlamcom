About a month ago, I was questioning everything about my approach to tech, especially as a university student. Today, I'm writing this with a Vercel internship, still trying to fully understand how my life completely changed in a couple of weeks.

## When Everything Goes Wrong

Let me start with the lows, since that's where most stories start.

I was supposed to do a research internship with what I thought was a great company. I'd gone through their process, chosen a research proposal I was excited about, and then... nothing. I was **ghosted** by the company.

I was pretty new to job searching, so this rejection hurt since I thought I'd be doing my first Summer internship. It's not just about the opportunity, it messes with your self-worth. I started questioning maybe my portfolio was too weak, or maybe I did certain things wrong.

The interviews after weren't all that much better. I kept facing rejections, mainly because I didn't know how to prepare properly for LeetCode-styled questions I didn't study for.

## The YC MCP Hackathon

About a few weeks after, one of my friends invited me to a hackathon at Y Combinator. I almost didn't go since I started thinking hackathons were a waste of time since most projects are ditched after the hackathon. I ended up going anyway, and I'm glad I did.

That decision to show up changed everything.

I got teamed up with some people at UBC I'd never met before, and this one person completely shifted how I thought about opportunities. He said something that stuck with me.

> "You can literally just reach out to anyone you want. Want an internship with Vercel? Email Guillermo and ask. Want investors to look at your startup? Just email them."

He was optimistic, delusionally so. As someone with limited professional experience, this perspective was genuinely helpful, even if I didn't fully believe it yet. He had faith in me throughout the hackathon when I didn't have much faith in myself.

## Taking the Leap

We flew from Vancouver to SF for the YC hackathon. I decided to fly out a bit earlier and, remembering my teammate's advice, started reaching out to people on *X (the everything platform)*. The tech distribution on that platform is incredible, I got invited to Founders Inc. and a couple of different offices **just because I asked**.

During the hackathon, we created *Spec2MCP*, drop an OpenAPI spec and our project turns it into a ready-deployed MCP server. We didn't win any prizes, but heard after from judges that we got 4th place and were being debated for 3rd.

Guillermo, one of the judges, mentioned that he really liked the UI/UX of the project (which is what I was mainly responsible for).

## Sending That Email

I decided to follow up and email Vercel directly. My expectations were pretty low, but I kept thinking about what my friend said earlier about having a *delusional sense of optimism*. To my surprise, I heard back. A recruiter reached out and invited me to the San Francisco office.

That feeling was incredible. I thought *"what the hell"* and went in with zero expectations.

We had a great conversation. The recruiter walked me through the process and what to expect. A few rounds later, I got an email I had to read a few times to believe. An offer from Vercel. I accepted and I'm starting my Vercel internship in September.

## What I learned in SF

While in SF, I kept reaching out to people on X. I connected with Sonith @ *Z Fellows*, reached out to folks at *Railway*, *Hugging Face*, and discovered how accessible people actually are. **People want to help in any way they can.**

Through *Z Fellows*, I had the opportunity to be a photographer and met incredible people. Through them, I got introduced to *Cluely* and even crashed at their office for a couple nights. The CTO at *Whop* invited me to their office too.

If you want to build and make real change, I can't recommend SF or a major tech hub enough. It's remarkably easy to make connections and find people who are willing to help if you just ask.

## LeetCode or Projects?

So far, throughout university, I made a choice that made me question the future: I decided to build cool projects instead of grinding LeetCode.

I actually avoid LeetCode unless it has real-world applications. I'm more interested in how different systems work together to create something applicable.

Most people around me focused on LeetCode, which is fine. I believe this is the traditional approach in landing internships. In contrast, I chose to build projects that were fun for me.

I've realized that by choosing projects, I learned how real-world systems *actually* work. I can plan projects, understand what infrastructure is needed, and figure out how things should work together. When I don't know something, I have the tools to learn it.

So if you're someone like me, who enjoys building projects instead of grinding LeetCode-styled questions, my advice would be to choose projects that challenge your thinking and push you to understand how systems really work. What I've learned from the people around me (especially in SF) has been that doing things with passion has a way of rewarding you.

Build because you want to, not because you have to.

## What I've Learned (So Far)

I want to be clear: I haven't *"made it."* I'm still figuring things out, still learning. But here's what this experience has taught me:

- **People are more accessible than you think.** That CEO or founder you wanna talk to? They're probably reachable if you approach them thoughtfully and genuinely.
- **Your path doesn't have to look like everyone else's.** Going against conventional wisdom (like choosing projects over LeetCode grinding) can work if you're intentional about what you're learning.
- **Patience pays off, even when you're unsure of the direction.** A month ago, I had no idea this opportunity would come from a hackathon I almost skipped.
- **Show up.** Half the battle is just showing up-at the hackathon, in SF, in conversations with people who might change your views.
- **Have faith.** Sometimes you won't see the path forward, but if you keep building, keep learning, keep putting yourself out there, things have a way of working themselves out.

This isn't a success story, it's a story about shifting your mindset. About realizing that the game is more open than I thought, that **people are more willing to help** than I expected, and that sometimes the best opportunities come from the risks you almost don't take.

Whatever you're building, whatever path you're on, have faith. Just keep doing what you're doing. You might be closer to something amazing than you think.
