Have you ever noticed how our definition of happiness seems to shift as we age? Recently, I've found myself in deep conversations with friends about this theme – the interesting intersection of happiness and ambition, and how our relationship with both changes over time. These discussions have revealed a pattern that I believe relates to many of us in our younger years.

## The Childhood-Adult Transition: From Dreams to Pragmatism

There's something uniquely interesting about how adults reminisce about their childhood. It seems that many often talk about how it was a simpler time, and in many ways, it was. Our dreams weren't bounded by market demands or practical considerations – they were bounded only by our imagination.

I remember my own journey: dreaming of becoming an astronaut, then pivoting to aerospace engineering. In my mind at the time, space represented infinite possibilities. When I talk to others about their childhood aspirations, they say something similar – astronauts, doctors, artists, scientists.

But something interesting happens as we grow older. We go through subtle changes from doing things because "it's fun" to doing things because "it's practical." I don't think this change in mindset is negative, but it raises important questions about how we define success and fulfillment.

## The Quarter-Life Crisis: A Modern Phenomenon

The feeling of being lost in your twenties has become quite common (or at least around me, it seems like that). We find ourselves at this crucial point where childhood dreams are combined with adult realities. The pressure to have it all figured out – career, relationships, life purpose – it seems like it's overwhelming, and in many ways, it is.

But lately, I've come to embrace a different perspective: the uncertainty isn't a sign of failure; it's an opportunity to continue exploring. I've learned to understand that in many situations, you won't always know what right and wrong is, what the clear direction is, and the next step is just to take that leap of faith.

The rush to "figure it all out" seems that it stems from comparing ourselves with other people. It seems that we often downplay ourselves, then compare to others' better moments. In reality, I've been slowly learning that the only competition and only person you should be comparing to is yourself, more specifically, your past self.

Being able to be better than who you were yesterday, last week, last month, or last year is the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter if you're 1% better than you were a year ago, change is change, and improvement is improvement. It's a journey of self improvement.

## Redefining Success: Beyond the Conventional Narrative

I believe that society often tells us that the path to happiness is linear: good grades $\rightarrow$ prestigious university $\rightarrow$ high—paying job $\rightarrow$ material success $\rightarrow$ happiness.

But this formula seems increasingly incompatible for many of us. We're beginning to question whether going this route to success actually leads to fulfillment.

What I've observed is that true fulfillment often comes from unexpected sources:

- The satisfaction of personal growth, even in small steps
- Taking time to self reflect
- Meaningful connections and conversations with others
- Pursuing interests that might not have obvious monetary value, purely out of interest
- Learning to appreciate the journey rather than fixating on the destination

## Finding Your Own Path

Perhaps the most valuable lesson I'm learning is that it's okay to write your own definition of success (and you should!). The magical answer isn't in following someone else's footsteps.

This doesn't mean abandoning ambition. Rather, it means aligning our ambitions with ourself, what we want to do. This seems hard nowadays with the pressures of both society, and our relationships. It means understanding that success isn't a race, and there's no universal timeline we must follow.

## A New Perspective on Happiness

I've come to question the path for happiness and fulfillment, and maybe the goal isn't to chase an idealized version of happiness that society has constructed. Maybe it's about:

- Embracing uncertainty as a natural part of growth
- Finding joy in the present while working toward the future
- Building a life that feels authentic and meaningful rather than impressive
- Understanding that our path doesn't need to look like anyone else's

At least, that's the perspective I'm starting to embrace. I'm beginning to see that happiness isn't a destination but a journey, and the most important part is enjoying the ride.

## Final Thoughts

It really appears that the relationship between happiness and ambition isn't straightforward—it changes as we do. While our childhood dreams might seem very different now, they're a good reminder of a time that we thought anything was possible, and we weren't constrained by the harsh realities of the world. Maybe the key isn't to abandon that mindset entirely, but to adopt a hybrid mindset with the wisdom we've gained over the years.

Maybe the real achievement isn't in having all the answers, but in becoming comfortable with the questions. After all, isn't life more about the story we're writing than the destination we're rushing toward?

This one was a bit more deep than usual, but I hope you enjoyed it! I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic, and if you've experienced similar feelings in your own life.
