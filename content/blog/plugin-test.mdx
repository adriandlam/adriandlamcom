title: "Plugin Test - MDX Features Showcase"
publishedAt: "2025-11-12"
summary: "A comprehensive test of all MDX plugins including rehype-pretty-code, external links, math, GFM features, and smart typography."
tags: ["test", "mdx", "plugins"]
---

This post demonstrates all the MDX plugins integrated into the blog, including the newly added ones.

<Callout>
<CalloutTitle>📖 Note on Reading Time</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>
The `remark-reading-time` plugin is integrated and calculates reading time automatically. It's available in `file.data.readingTime` for programmatic use, though direct MDX variable export would require additional configuration.
</CalloutDescription>

## Table of Contents

This page will showcase:

- Code syntax highlighting with rehype-pretty-code
- External link handling
- Math equations with KaTeX
- GitHub Flavored Markdown features
- Smart typography
- And more!

## Code Highlighting (rehype-pretty-code)

### Basic JavaScript

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to my blog, ${name}`;
}

greet("World");
```

### TypeScript with React

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const UserCard: React.FC<{ user: User }> = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Python Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = [fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)]
print(fib_sequence)
```

### Bash/Shell Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Deploy script
echo "Starting deployment..."
npm run build
npm run test

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Build successful, deploying..."
    npm run deploy
else
    echo "Build failed, aborting deployment"
    exit 1
fi
```

## External Links (rehype-external-links)

Here are some external links that should open in a new tab with proper security attributes:

- [Google](https://google.com) - External link
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - External link
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - External link
- [Internal Link](/blog) - This should NOT open in new tab

External links automatically get `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes!

## Math Equations (remark-math + rehype-katex)

### Inline Math

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and it's really useful.

Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$

### Block Math

The Pythagorean theorem:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Euler's identity (one of the most beautiful equations):

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

Matrix multiplication:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Summation notation:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## GitHub Flavored Markdown (remark-gfm)

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Syntax Highlighting | ✅ Done | High |
| External Links | ✅ Done | High |
| Math Support | ✅ Done | Medium |
| Tables | ✅ Done | Low |

### Task Lists

- [x] Integrate rehype-pretty-code
- [x] Add rehype-external-links
- [x] Add rehype-unwrap-images
- [x] Test remark-reading-time
- [ ] Write more blog posts
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle

### Strikethrough

~~This text is crossed out~~ but this text is not.

## Smart Typography (remark-smartypants)

Notice the smart quotes and dashes:

- "Double quotes" become curly quotes
- 'Single quotes' also become curly
- Don't, won't, can't -- apostrophes work too
- Em dash --- like this
- En dash -- for ranges
- Ellipsis...

Compare:

- Regular: "Hello" 'world' -- ---
- Smart: "Hello" 'world' – —

## Code Callouts

<Callout>
<CalloutTitle>💡 Pro Tip</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>
You can use custom components like these Callouts in your MDX! They're defined in the components object and work seamlessly with all the plugins.
</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout>
<CalloutTitle>⚠️ Warning</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>
Make sure to install all dependencies with `bun install` before running the development server.
</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Inline Code

You can use inline code like `const x = 42` or `npm install` within your paragraphs. The styling is optimized for readability.

## Blockquotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
>
> — Steve Jobs

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines and will be
> styled consistently across the blog.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
    - Deeply nested item
- Third item

### Ordered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
3. Third step

## Combined Example

Here's a realistic example combining multiple features:

The time complexity of binary search is $O(\log n)$, which makes it much faster than linear search with $O(n)$ complexity. Here's an implementation:

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;  // Found the target!
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;  // Search right half
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;  // Search left half
    }
  }
  
  return -1;  // Target not found
}

// Test it out
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15];
console.log(binarySearch(numbers, 7));  // Output: 3
```

You can learn more about algorithms on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) or in [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/).
