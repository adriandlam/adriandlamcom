I made a joke website called [UBC Purity Test](https://ubcpuritytest.com/) that gives you a scored based on your UBC experience. It was a fun project to work on, and I thought it would be a fun idea to make a similar one for Queen's University.

## Why I Made It

One of my friends at Queen's University, [Michael](https://x.com/Mike_TheSolo), recently made a website called [Queen's Purity Test](https://queenspuritytest.com/).

He showed me his analytics, and I was genuinely shocked that it had over 8k views in just 2 days.

So I decided to make my own version of it for UBC with [Ryan](https://x.com/ryanharaki_). It took around 3 hours to make, most of the time was spent on the actual questions themselves.

We added a database for computing averages according to categories, with Redis ratelimiting so that no CS students could do something mischievious.

## How It Got Semi-viral

At 9am sharp on March 31st, we sent a Reddit post to the r/ubc subreddit. Within the first 10 minutes, we hit ~50 views. That's when I knew we were onto something. 

We were able to get alot of traction from the post, with peak traffic having ~730 visitors in an hour, with ~80 at a time. If you want more metrics take a look at this image below:
